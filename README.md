# tezos-scripting

Run `setup_workspace.sh` before doing anything, this will downoad tezos, and install its dependencies, along with those for Conseil, and any of the other features built into this tool.

This will ask for root privilege when running, which you should provice ONLY AFTER ENSURING THAT THE SCRIPT YOU ARE RUNNING IS DOING AS EXPECTED!

After that, you can just run `start.sh` in the root directory of the project, and visit https://localhost:5000 to see the running UI.
